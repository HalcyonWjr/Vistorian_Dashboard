# Vistorian Dashboard
This repository is for my ongoing MSc disseration.  The topic is to design an analytic dashboard for [Vistorian](https://vistorian.net/), an online network visualization tool.

## Content
Currently this repo is for sharing codes within the team: 
- [**Data**](https://github.com/HalcyonWjr/Vistorian_Dashboard/tree/master/data) folder stores the data template for each chart used in the dashboard. The current data are in json files format.
- [**Charts-vegalite**](https://github.com/HalcyonWjr/Vistorian_Dashboard/tree/master/charts-vegalite) folder contains all the chart implemented in vega-lite, a json grammar for generating visualizations. To view the rendered interactive charts, one should copy all the codes in a file, and paste them in [**Vega-lite online editor**](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite) , it would automatically render. If it doesn't work, just click the run button on top.
